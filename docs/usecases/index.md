# Using lakeFS

This section gives you an overview of use cases across three stages in your process: development, deployment, and production.  

## In development

As part of routine work with data, we develop new code, improve and upgrade old code, upgrade infrastructures, and test new technologies. lakeFS gives you a safe development environment on your data lake - check this guide to see all the use cases.

## During deployment

We introduce new data to our lake - and even if the code and infra donâ€™t change, the data might, and these changes introduce potential quality issues. lakeFS helps to deal with that. Check out this guide to discover more use cases.

## In production

Errors with data in production are bound to occur. When they do, the best thing we can do is remove the erroneous data, understand why the issue happened, and deploy changes that prevent it from occurring again. This is where lakeFS helps as well - take a look at this page to see more use cases.
