# Set up lakeFS

Once you install lakeFS, it's just a few simple steps to start working. The first step is to [create a bucket/container](./storage/index.md) in your underlying storage. If you already have one, you are ready to [create your first lakeFS repository](./create-repo.md). Take a look at the guides below to learn more.


## Prepare your storage

A production installation of lakeFS will usually use your cloud providerâ€™s object storage as the underlying storage layer. Check out this guide to learn how to prepare your storage.

lakeFS supports this, but requires some configuration - here's a handy guide.
