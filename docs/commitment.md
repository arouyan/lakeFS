# Our commitment to open source

lakeFS is an open source project under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
The project was created and is supported by Treeverse, a commercial company founded by engineers who are passionate about building solutions to the evolving world of data engineering.

***Why did we choose to open the source of our core capabilities?***

We believe in the bottom-up adoption of technologies.
We trust that collaborative communities have the power to bring the best solutions to the community.
We believe small organizations should be able to use cutting edge technologies for free, so they can innovate in their domain and compete with well-established companies.

As a commercial organization, we intend to use the open core model.

***What is our commitment to open source?***

We define our open source project lakeFS as the data lake management platform that provides Git-like operations over an object-storage that can be utilized by any applications accessing the data lake. 

In other words, the following features will always remain part of lakeFS:
  - Versioning capabilities,
  - ACID Guarantees,
  - Git-like interface for the versioning operations,
  - Support for public object store APIs,
  - Integration with publicly available applications accessing an object storage,
  - Clear CLI, API, and GUI interfaces.
  
We also commit to make lakeFS scalable in throughput and performance, supporting multi-region architecture.
We are deeply committed to our community of engineers who use and contribute to the project. We are and will continue to be highly responsive and shape lakeFS together to provide the data lake management capabilities we are all looking for.

***What will be included in the commercial layer?***

This will take a while to figure out as currently everything we do is open source. But in the future, we will provide a commercial offering in line with users’ feedback.

For example, SLA-based support has already been requested by some of our design partners. Apparently some organizations feel comfortable with being early adopters of technology if they have the guarantee that when an issue arises someone is committed contractually to resolve it within a given SLA. If this is your preference, we are here for you.

In addition, in the future, we may choose to provide usability features over the core capabilities, enterprise features revolving around user management and security, and a SaaS offering.
