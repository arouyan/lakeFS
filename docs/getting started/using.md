# Using lakeFS

## In development

Data practitioners usually develop new code, improve and upgrade old code, upgrade infrastructures, and test new technologies. 
lakeFS gives you a safe development environment without the need to copy or mock data, work on the pipelines, or involve DevOps engineers.

## In deployment

You introduce new data to the lake every day. And even if the code and infra donâ€™t change, the data might. Those changes introduce potential quality issues.
lakeFS helps you handle this trnasient nature of data.

## In production

Sooner or later, you're bound to run into errors with data in production. When that happens, the best thing you can do is remove the erroneous data, 
understand why the issue happened, and deploy changes that prevent it from happening again. lakeFS gives you a helping hand here.
